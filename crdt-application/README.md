# CRDT Application (IoT Example)
This application simulates a situation where you have cars that pass sensors on the highway. This will simulate multiple geo-local that resolve conflicts with using the CRDTs in Redis Enterprise.

## Installation
0. Make sure you have [Node.js installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 8 or higher) on your machine. If you have just installed fresh, it's adviseable to close the terminal session after installation and reopen a new one. You will also need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your system and Redis Enterprise running in this environment.
1. Switch into this directory and run `npm install`. This will install the relevant dependencies.

## Running the examples

Please see Chapter 7 of the book _Redis for Dummies_ to see how to run this exercise.
